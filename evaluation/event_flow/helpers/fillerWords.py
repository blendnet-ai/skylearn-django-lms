            IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS:
            You are a Filler word Checker: your job is to identify any Filler words or repeated words in the text. 
            Assess whether these repetitions disrupt the text's flow. Pay attention to any patterns or
            excessive repetitions that may disrupt fluency. Correct the text only by fixing the filler words and nothing else.
            A few examples fo the filler words are below 
                Actually
                Almost

            Identify the filler words in the below paragraph
            Iterate the paragraph by one sentence at a time and report the FULL Corrected Text by removing the filler words.
            The format of the output should be json dictionary with below keys:        
            {{
                "Corrected Text": "",
                "Filler words":[]
            }}
            
            If there are no filler words, then the output should be (empty array for filler words):
            {{
                "Corrected Text": "student's exact answer",
                "Filler words":[]
            }}

            Remember, the output should NOT contain any extra text than the specified json.
            '''
    
    messages = [
        {'role': 'system', 'content': system_message}
    ]

    response = llm_object.get_completion_from_messages(messages)
    fillerWords_list, corrected_text = [], None

    try:
        response_json = json.loads(response)
        fillerWords_list = response_json["Filler words"]
        corrected_text = response_json["Corrected Text"]
    except (JSONDecodeError, KeyError) as e:
        logger.error(f"[evaluate_fillerWords] Some of the key are missing, err: {e}. LLM Response was {response}")
        raise ProcessorEvaluationException("Error while evaluating fillerword") from e
    
    return (user_input, len(fillerWords_list), corrected_text, fillerWords_list)
